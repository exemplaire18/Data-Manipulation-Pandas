# Data-Manipulation-Pandas
This repository contains tutorials, datasets and solutions of assignments given in the course 'Introduction to Data Science in Python', part of Applied Data Science using Python Specialization from University of Michigan offered by Coursera.

This course introduces the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course introduces data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.
